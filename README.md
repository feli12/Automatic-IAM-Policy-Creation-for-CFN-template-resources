# Automatic-IAM-Policy-Creation-for-CFN-template-resources
# Hackathon project

The proposed work is built to assist PS engineers and users who find it difficult to attach IAM Policies to a CFN Template. 

It reduces the effort of the users who manually write the policies. 

The non-root users who donâ€™t have the required permission to create those resources will be automatically given those permissions.
